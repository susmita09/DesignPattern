You are tasked with designing a Payment Gateway System for an e-commerce platform that can
process payments through multiple third-party payment gateways.
The system should allow integration with multiple payment providers, such as PayPal, Stripe, and Razorpay.
Each provider has its own API and
interface for processing payments, which are incompatible with your system's standard interface.

 Your
payment system should provide a unified interface for the platform, regardless of the payment gateway used.


Requirments

1. The system should define a standard interface for payment processing (e.g., PaymentProcessor)
that the client application uses.
2. Each payment provider should be integrated without modifying their existing APIs.
3. The system should be extendable so new payment providers can be added with minimal effort.
4. The solution should ensure the platform remains agnostic to the underlying gateway implementation.
