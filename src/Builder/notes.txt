Builder is a creational design pattern (helps in creation of object)

1. if we have a object which has lot of optional filed and few are mandatory
we can have very big constructor parameter field

we can have small small constructor, here the number of constructor will become huge
and if we need any new combination of parameter we need to add it(need to modify our code violating ocp)

2. if you want to do some kind of validation then also can be used

Builder is a step by step object creation process
example - object House it compose of roof, door, walls, window

if we do addroof -> addwall -> addwindow -> adddoor .build()
(intermediate objects can toughter build the main object0
