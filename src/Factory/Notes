factory is a creational design pattern
it helps to create object
when we need to create diff object based on some condition - means when we need conditional basis object we
can use factory pattern to avoid code duplication.

example - let say we have a shape interface
          <<shape>>
           draw()
      square        rectangle     circle   (extends shape)

      now in our code we need different object of square or rectangle

   to create the object of these class we will use a shapeFactory class

      shapeFactory ---------- has-a -----> shape object

    public shape  getShape(based on this){
           //based on the passed parameter we will create conditional object

           }
